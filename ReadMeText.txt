It displays the title "home page" at the top center. Then at the right top corner, the navigation box with links for inventory, upload cards and market value pages.

Then, below the navigation box, it shows 3 preview for other pages for: total cards uploaded, Your MTG card with highest value, and buy, sell, exchange mtg cards.

At the bottom is the footer with an animated background saying "website under construction"
